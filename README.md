# üîä Audio Similarity Checker

This is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to upload and compare two audio files to determine how similar they sound. The tool visualizes waveforms and computes a similarity score using audio embeddings.

## üß† Features

- Upload and listen to two audio files (`.wav` or `.mp3`)
- View waveform plots for each speaker
- Extract speaker embeddings from both files
- Compute and display a similarity score
- Intuitive UI built using Streamlit

## üöÄ Live Demo

> Coming soon (you can deploy this app to [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) or [Render](https://render.com))!

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for UI
- [Librosa](https://librosa.org/) for audio processing
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for waveform visualization
- Custom audio embedding extraction using `extract_embedding` and `get_similarity_score`

## Requirements
- streamlit - 1.35.0
- librosa - 0.10.1
- matplotlib - 3.8.4
- numpy - 1.26.4
- soundfile - 0.12.1
- scikit-learn - 1.4.2
- torch - 2.2.2
- torchaudio - 2.2.2
- pyannote-audio - 3.1.1


## üì• Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/audio-similarity-checker.git
   cd audio-similarity-checker

2. Install dependencies:
      Note: The pyannote-audio library downloads models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) (e.g. pyannote/embedding). You‚Äôll need to be logged into Hugging Face via CLI or API token, especially for some models that require authentication.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the app
   ```bash
   streamlit run app_streamlit.py


## üìä Similarity Score

The similarity score is computed using pre-trained audio embeddings. If the score is above a threshold (default 0.7), the audios are considered similar.

## üîí Disclaimer

This tool is intended for research or demo purposes only and may not generalize perfectly to all audio types or languages.
